# Hangman game in React + Redux
This project is an implementation of the [Hangman game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). It is a work in progress with the intention of learning Redux and React.

## Running the game
1. Clone this repository
2. Change to the project directory (eg. hangman-react-redux)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

## Roadmap
- [x] Base logic implementation
- [ ] Define CSS/images strategy
- [ ] Initial theme/layout design
- [ ] Initial Chances view (the hangman, but can be anything that provides adequate feedback)
- [ ] Redux-dev-tools integration (tricky due to recent version of React/Babel/DevTools)
- [ ] Game over logic
- [ ] Word pool from predefined values, or external fetch, and logic to select/pick them
- [ ] Hints
- [ ] i18n?
